**Matt here:** I wanted to try my hand at this THT, even though I am not interviewing for any positions at Ka-ching. Gotta keep practicing. :)

May continue working on it past the two hour mark.

# Ka-ching's Take Home Assignment for the position of Junior iOS Developer

This repository contains a take home assignment that is a part of the interviewing process for the position of Junior iOS Developer at Ka-ching

===

# Your mission

Hey iOS developer. Welcome. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to spend 2 hours creating an iOS app demonstrating common tasks such as fetching data over network, parsing model entities from JSON, UI and navigation.

> **Hey this is important!**
> We hope you can spend about two hours on this project. If you can finish faster -- great! If not, limit yourself and don't spend much longer than 2 hours MAX.

# Your Tasks

* Fork this repository and check out your own fork as a basis for the app.
* The main page of your app should show the contents of a 'shopping basket'. Inititially the basket will be empty, but it should be possible to add products to the basket and also to clear the current contents of the basket.
* Products to be added should be fetched from the API endpoint included below. They should be presented on a separate view controller, and the presentation should include at least the product name and image.
* When products have been added to the shopping basket, they should be visible on the main page along with a total, that is the sum of the retail prices of all the products added to the basket.
* Be creative with this. We want to see a functional app that demonstrates knowledge with the platform and the language. When in doubt, make an executive decision. *Functionality is more important than the look and feel*. If you finish early, feel free to polish it up.
* For instance: If the same product is added twice you are welcome to either show it twice in the basket - or show it once with a quantity of 2. That is up to you. You may choose to add functionality to display further details about a product - like the description, but only do this if you have the time.
* Once finished, send a link to your fork of the repository to operations@ka-ching.dk

# Some tips

* We've provided some boilerplate code for you to get up and running! We encourage you to use it if you think it will help, but feel free to roll your own solution if you like. The boilerplate code uses a Storyboard for the UI, but you are also welcome to throw that away, build everything in code or even use SwiftUI.
* We've added a (very simple) mock network client. You may choose to use this until you implement the networking.
* Feel free to use iOS 13 as the deployment target, so that you can use the latest and greates APIs from Apple.

# Grading

The exercise will be graded on a number of criteria including, but not limited to:

* Clean and readable code
* Code that to some extent follows the SOLID principles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
* Demonstrated knowledge of MVC, delegation, UI and navigation, fetching and parsing JSON data, git, dependency management*

NOTES: 

* If you choose to use another architecture than MVC (e.g. MVVM, MVP, VIPER, TCA) then don't worry about the MVC requirement
* If you choose another way of getting information from a child VC to a parent than through delegation (e.g. some reactive framework or something else) then don't worry about demonstrating knowledge about delegation.
* If you choose not to use any third party dependencies, but do everything on your own, don't worry about dependency management.
* You are free to choose between UIKit and SwiftUI, but choose the technology that you're comfortable with so that you can complete the task within the time limit.


# Micro API

There is only one API request:

    https://run.mocky.io/v3/4e23865c-b464-4259-83a3-061aaee400ba

The result is a JSON object with keys and values, where the values are 'Product' entities. The entities are keyed by their id.
